# NotNull
A library to help catch null references at runtime.

I created this library as a response to a question on Stack Overflow about 
null reference exceptions in C#.

I created it as an example of how you can use a plain code solution to help
identify and catch null reference exceptions being passed in the code.

The solution is modeled after the Nullable<T> type in C#.
