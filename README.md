# NotNull
A library to help catch null references at runtime. Think of it as a null guard.

I created this library as a response to a question on Stack Overflow about 
null reference exceptions in C#.

I created it as an example of how you can use a plain code solution to help
identify and catch null reference exceptions being passed in the code.

This solution is modeled after the Nullable<T> type in C#.
